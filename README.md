## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a techie with over 8 years of experience, now diving headfirst into the exciting world of Data Science!
I've led teams and built some pretty cool projects. I'm a Python and Power BI enthusiast, and I'm absolutely
fascinated by machine learning. I'm using these tools to uncover insights from data and build amazing models.
I'm Google Data Analytics certified and always up for a challenge. I love finding creative ways to use data
to solve problems and help businesses make smart decisions.

## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are a few things I've been building lately. Feel free to browse my projects!

* **[ðŸ“‰ Save my business - Churn prediction](https://github.com/Drieger/ml-churn-classification)** <br />
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning, enabling proactive retention strategies. By analyzing customer data, a model will identify high-risk individuals, allowing for targeted interventions to maximize customer lifetime value.

* **[ðŸª» The famous Iris flower data set](https://github.com/Drieger/iris-dataset-eda)** <br />
Trained several classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) on the classic iris dataset. Explored feature engineering and model evaluation.

* **[ðŸš² Cyclistic Bike Share Data Analysis](https://github.com/Drieger/cyclistic-data-analysis)** <br/>
This project analyzed historical bike-sharing data from Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, to understand the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. The goal was to identify opportunities to convert occasional riders into annual members through targeted marketing strategies.
