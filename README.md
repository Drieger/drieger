## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a techie with over 8 years of experience, now diving headfirst into the exciting world of Data Science!
I've led teams and built some pretty cool projects. I'm a Python and Power BI enthusiast, and I'm absolutely
fascinated by machine learning. I'm using these tools to uncover insights from data and build amazing models.
I'm Google Data Analytics certified and always up for a challenge. I love finding creative ways to use data
to solve problems and help businesses make smart decisions.
